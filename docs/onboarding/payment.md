# Payment Connection

Once you've linked all your accounts, the next step is to set up your payment method. As a member of Antimetal's organization, we handle your billing. This means you'll receive a monthly invoice for your AWS charges from us, not AWS. Therefore, we require a payment method on file to grant you access to the platform.

Antimetal uses Stripe for payment processing. To connect your payment method, choose your preferred currency (USD or EUR) and click the "Connect Payment Method" button. You'll be redirected to a secure Stripe page to input your payment details.

Antimetal provides the flexibility to connect either a credit card or a bank account.

:::warning
Please note, Antimetal imposes a 2.9% payment processing fee for non-ACH payments. ACH payments, however, are exempt from this fee. We strongly advise connecting a bank account to avoid these additional charges
