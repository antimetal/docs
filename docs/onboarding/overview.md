# Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the onboarding process. 

Here are the key steps you'll need to complete:

1. [**Create Your Antimetal Account:**](/onboarding/account_creation) Start by creating your account at [<u>app.antimetal.com</u>](https://app.antimetal.com). You will have to fill out some basic company information as part of our Know Your Customer (KYC) process. This helps us understand your business better.
2. [**Add the IAM role:**](/onboarding/iam_role_creation): Grant Antimetal access to your AWS account(s) by creating an IAM role.
3. [**Download Existing Cost Explorer Data:**](/onboarding/payment): Download a CSV file of your Cost Explorer Data so you don't lose your data and so you can compare & contrast your AWS bill upon joining Antimetal’s organization.
4. [**Add A Payment Method:**](/onboarding/company_info): Connect your preferred payment method to your Antimetal account. You can do this with a bank account, credit card, or via Stripe.
5. [**Join Antimetal’s Organization:**](/onboarding/csv): The final step involves joining our organization. If your account(s) are within an existing organization, you will simply leave that one and join Antimetal’s. Again, this is just a billing switch and does not affect your underlying architecture. It’s how you gain access to savings and our platform.

Each of these steps will be explained in detail in the following sections.
