# Billing

**I am looking to understand the differences between what's on the invoice and what's in AWS billing.**  

The reason here and why Antimetal gives “risk-free savings”, is that you might get savings by consuming savings instruments in another person’s account.  

For example, Company X used a savings plan in Company Y’s account to cover their EC2 spend (since Company X is not using the whole thing). However, AWS doesn’t show the associated savings plan cost on Company X’s account, since Company Y was the one to purchase the instrument, but Antimetal will still display these savings on Company X dashboard.  

Let’s say Company X received $1416.10 in savings. Company X received those savings by using $711.41 of savings instruments in other companies' accounts (i.e Company Y). To be equitable, we pass on any savings instruments cost you consumed to you—it wouldn’t be fair to charge Company Y for savings plan usage used by Company X.  

For more specific questions regarding differences between your companies’ invoices and AWS cost explorer, please contact support@antimetal.com.
