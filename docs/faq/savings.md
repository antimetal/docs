# Savings

**Where do we see how much Antimetal is actually saving us? Is that the Monthly Savings KPI on the top right? These numbers seem to be lower than expected.**  

Monthly savings are the unique savings generated by Antimetal (excludes any savings instruments you purchased or came in with when joining).

**What's the difference between the savings that are automatically accounted for, and those that are pending approval? Why do they require approval?**  

We automatically approve savings plan recommendations (for Sagemaker and Compute since they are extremely flexible). We expose RI recommendations to you and filter the RI recs for ones that we feel are stable and good choices; however, you know your infrastructure better than us, so we require you to approve any recommendation before making those purchases.

**How often are SPs(Savings Plans) and RIs (Reserved Instances) information pulled into the Antimetal Platform?**  

SP and RIs information are pulled daily into the platform.
