# Tax

By becoming a part of our organization, all customers inherit Antimetal's Delaware-based address.
Delaware does not impose Service Tax or VAT on digital goods, which means customers will not see any tax charges on their bills.

We view this as a significant advantage for all members of Antimetal, irrespective of their original tax jurisdiction.
The elimination of tax not only results in additional savings but also simplifies the process of reviewing and understanding your bill. Furthermore, it saves you valuable time by removing the need for tax reclamation or refund procedures.
