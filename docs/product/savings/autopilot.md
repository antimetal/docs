# Autopilot

Antimetal is commited to help our customers achieve savings in a sustainable way, which is why we recommend staggering Compute Savings Plans. Our methodologies are explained [<u>**in this document**</u>](/product/savings/savings_plans).
Staggering savings plans require modular commitments, which increases overhead, so we rolled out the Autopilot feature to auto-purchase savings plans.

:::info
Reserved Instances (RI) are more restrictive relative to Compute Savings Plans, so RIs require manual approval and will not be part of Autopilot.
