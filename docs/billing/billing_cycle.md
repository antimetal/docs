# Billing Cycle

By joining Antimetal, we take on the responsibility of managing your AWS billing. We consolidate your AWS usage and provide you with a single invoice. This invoice is generated on <strong>the 6th</strong>
 of every month, processed on the <strong>8th</strong>, and is due on the <strong>23rd</strong> of the same month, following Net15 terms.

The most important invoicing dates are:

- The 6th of the month: Invoice is sent to you and available in the dashboard
- The 8th of the month: Payment is processed
- The 23rd of the month: Payment is due

If you join in the middle of the month, you will receive two invoices for that month. The first invoice will be from AWS for the usage before you joined Antimetal, and the second invoice will be from Antimetal for the usage after you joined. For all following months, you will just receive a single invoice from Antimetal.
